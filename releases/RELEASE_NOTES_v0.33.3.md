# 🚀 ChatLima v0.33.3 - Real-Time Model Updates & Enhanced BYOK Experience

## 🎯 What's New

This patch release introduces real-time model list updates and enhanced API key management, providing a seamless experience when users add or remove their provider API keys.

### ⚡ Real-Time Model Refresh
- **Instant Updates**: Model list automatically refreshes when API keys are saved or cleared, no page reload required
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: New event dispatching system enables cross-component synchronization
- **Live Model Availability**: Model picker instantly reflects changes in available models based on current API key status

### 🔑 Enhanced API Key Management
- **Improved BYOK Logic**: Refined model filtering to accurately determine which users can access premium models
- **Better Key Detection**: Enhanced validation ensures API keys are properly detected and applied
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users see immediate changes in model availability when managing API keys

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- **Smart Model Picker**: Displays accurate model availability based on user authentication and API key status
- **Context-Aware Filtering**: Model list intelligently adapts to user's current authentication state and available credits

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Event System for API Key Changes
New event dispatching enables real-time updates across components:

**`components/api-key-manager.tsx`**
- Dispatches custom events when API keys are saved or cleared
- Events: `apiKeysSaved` and `apiKeysCleared`
- Enables decoupled component communication

```typescript
// Dispatch events for model refresh
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('apiKeysSaved'));
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('apiKeysCleared'));
```

### Enhanced Model Context
**`lib/context/model-context.tsx`** (88 lines added/modified)
- New state management for user API keys
- Event listeners for automatic model refresh
- Improved refresh logic that checks both authentication and API keys
- Better error handling and loading states

Key improvements:
- Tracks OpenRouter and Requesty API keys separately
- Automatically refreshes models when keys change
- Properly handles authentication state changes
- Cleans up event listeners on unmount

### Improved Model Filtering
**`app/api/models/route.ts`** (32 lines modified)
- Enhanced logic for determining premium model access
- Better integration with user API key checks
- More accurate filtering based on BYOK status
- Improved credit-based access control

### Smart Model Picker
**`components/model-picker.tsx`** (23 lines added)
- New checks for user API key availability
- Better display of model accessibility
- Improved user feedback on model selection
- Context-aware model filtering

### Hook Enhancements
**`hooks/use-models.ts`** (13 lines modified)
- Enhanced model fetching logic
- Better integration with user authentication
- Improved error handling and loading states

## 🛡️ Reliability & Performance

### Better State Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners prevents memory leaks
- Efficient re-rendering only when necessary
- Optimized model list updates

### Improved Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when API key checks fail
- Better handling of authentication state changes
- Robust event listener management

## 📈 Benefits

### For Users
- **Instant Feedback**: See model availability change immediately when adding/removing API keys
- **No Reloads Required**: Seamless experience without page refreshes
- **Clear Visibility**: Always know which models you can access based on your current setup
- **Better BYOK Experience**: More accurate and responsive premium model access

### For Developers
- **Clean Architecture**: Event-driven system makes component communication easier
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns between components
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new event types and listeners
- **Testable**: Decoupled components are easier to unit test

### For Platform Operators
- **Better UX**: Reduced friction in API key management workflow
- **Higher Engagement**: Users can quickly experiment with different provider setups
- **Reduced Support**: Clearer model availability reduces confusion

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
This is a patch release with **no breaking changes**. All existing functionality remains intact and is enhanced.

### Automatic Updates
If you have API keys already configured:
- The system will automatically detect them on page load
- Model lists will refresh to show your available models
- No action required from users

### For Developers
If you're extending the API key or model management system:
- Review new event system in `components/api-key-manager.tsx`
- Check updated model context in `lib/context/model-context.tsx`
- Event names: `apiKeysSaved` and `apiKeysCleared` are now part of the API

## 🚀 Deployment

### Standard Deployment Process
This release follows the standard deployment workflow:

```bash
# Already completed:
# 1. Version bumped to 0.33.3
# 2. Git tag created (v0.33.3)
