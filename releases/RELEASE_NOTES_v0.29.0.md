- **🧪 Enhanced Test Coverage**: Comprehensive Jest test suite for improved code quality and reliability
- **⚡ Performance Optimizations**: Better caching and compilation speed improvements

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **New API Routes**: 
  - `POST /api/chats/[id]/share` - Create shareable chat links
  - `GET /api/chats/[id]/share` - Check existing shares
  - `GET /api/chats/shared/[shareId]` - Retrieve shared chat content
- **Database Schema**: New `chatShares` table with secure share ID generation using nanoid
- **Chat Sharing Service**: Comprehensive service layer with snapshot creation and PII redaction
- **Shared Chat Components**: 
  - `SharedChatMessages` component for displaying shared content
  - `ChatShareDialog` with consent flow and privacy controls
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest configuration with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Security Enhancements**: Automatic sanitization of sensitive data in shared content

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- **Automatic PII Redaction**: Removes email addresses, phone numbers, API keys, and other sensitive data
- **Consent-Based Sharing**: Users must explicitly consent before creating shareable links
- **Secure Share IDs**: 32-character nanoid generation for unguessable share URLs
- **Content Sanitization**: Filters out system prompts and tool arguments from shared content
- **Authentication Protection**: Share creation requires user authentication
- **Privacy Indicators**: Clear labeling of shared content as "Read-only" with sharing metadata

## 📈 Benefits
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Easily share AI conversations with team members, colleagues, or for support
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Export valuable AI interactions for documentation and training purposes
- **Privacy Protection**: Automatic removal of sensitive information ensures safe sharing
- **Better User Experience**: Intuitive sharing dialog with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Improved Code Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage reduces bugs and improves maintainability
- **Performance Gains**: Optimized compilation and caching for faster development and runtime

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements
- **Intuitive Share Dialog**: Clean, step-by-step sharing process with clear privacy controls
- **Visual Share Indicators**: Share icons appear in chat lists for shared conversations
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: One-click copying of shareable URLs with confirmation feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Shared chat views work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Clear Privacy Messaging**: Transparent communication about what data is included in shares

## 🔄 Migration Notes
- **Database Migration**: New `chatShares` table automatically created via Drizzle migrations
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing chat functionality remains unchanged
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing chats and features continue to work normally
- **Optional Feature**: Chat sharing is opt-in and doesn't affect non-shared chats

## 🚀 Deployment
- **Standard Deployment**: Compatible with existing deployment pipeline
- **Environment Variables**: Uses existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for share URL generation
- **Database Migrations**: Automatically applied via Drizzle ORM
- **No Special Configuration**: Works with current authentication and database setup

## 🧩 Key Components Added
- `components/chat-share-dialog.tsx` - Main sharing interface with privacy controls
- `components/shared-chat-messages.tsx` - Optimized display for shared content
- `components/shared-message.tsx` - Individual message component for shared views
- `lib/services/chat-sharing.ts` - Core sharing service with security features
- `app/chats/shared/[shareId]/page.tsx` - Public shared chat viewing page
- Enhanced test suite with Jest and React Testing Library

## 🧪 Testing Enhancements
