### For Developers:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- New optional tool requires OpenRouter API key in `.env` file
- Scripts are completely separate from main application code

### Environment Setup:
```bash
# Add to your .env file (for developers only)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### New Commands Available:
```bash
# Run pricing analysis
pnpm run pricing:analysis

# Analyze historical data (if you have CSV exports)
python scripts/analyze-openrouter-data.py /path/to/data.csv
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development Environment:
1. Ensure OpenRouter API key is configured in `.env`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run analysis: `pnpm run pricing:analysis`

### Production Considerations:
- Scripts are development-only tools
- No impact on production application
- No new environment variables required for production deployment

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Quick Cost Analysis:
```bash
pnpm run pricing:analysis
```

### Expected Output:
