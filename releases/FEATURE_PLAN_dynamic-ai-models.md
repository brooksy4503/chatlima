# Feature: Dynamic AI Models

## üéØ Overview
Implement a dynamic AI model system that allows users to select and switch between different AI models dynamically during chat sessions. This feature will provide flexibility in model selection based on user preferences, use case requirements, and cost considerations.

## üìã Requirements
- [ ] Dynamic model selection interface in the chat UI
- [ ] Real-time model switching during conversations
- [ ] Model-specific parameter configuration
- [ ] Cost tracking per model selection
- [ ] Model availability and status indicators
- [ ] User preference persistence for model selection
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for unavailable models

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan
1. **Step 1**: Extend AI provider system to support dynamic model loading
   - Modify `ai/providers.ts` to handle dynamic model selection
   - Create model registry and configuration system
   - Implement model availability checking

2. **Step 2**: Update chat interface for model selection
   - Enhance `components/model-picker.tsx` for dynamic switching
   - Add model comparison and information display
   - Implement real-time model switching UI

3. **Step 3**: Backend API enhancements
   - Update chat API to handle model-specific requests
   - Implement model validation and routing
   - Add model usage tracking and analytics

4. **Step 4**: Database schema updates
   - Add model preferences to user settings
   - Create model usage tracking tables
   - Implement cost calculation per model

5. **Step 5**: Testing and validation
   - Unit tests for model switching logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for user model selection workflows

## üìÅ Files to Modify/Create
- `ai/providers.ts` - Dynamic model loading and configuration
- `components/model-picker.tsx` - Enhanced model selection UI
- `lib/model-context.tsx` - Model state management
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Model-specific request handling
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema for model preferences
- `components/chat.tsx` - Integration with dynamic model system
- `lib/types.ts` - Type definitions for dynamic models

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for model loading and switching logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints with different models
- E2E tests for complete model selection workflows
- Performance tests for model switching latency
- Cost tracking validation tests

## üìù Notes
- Consider implementing model caching for performance
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing chat sessions
- Plan for model-specific feature availability (e.g., vision, function calling)
- Consider implementing model recommendation system based on use case
- Monitor API rate limits and costs across different model providers
