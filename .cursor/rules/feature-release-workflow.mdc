# Feature Release Workflow

This rule provides a complete workflow for releasing new features in the ChatLima project, from merging feature branches to creating GitHub release notes.

## 🔄 Complete Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release Checks
Before starting the release process:
- Ensure all tests pass
- Verify the feature branch is up to date with main
- Check that [package.json](mdc:chatlima/package.json) reflects the current version
- Review recent commits with `git log --oneline -10`

### 2. Merge Feature Branch
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch (replace 'feature/branch-name' with actual branch)
git merge feature/branch-name

# Delete the feature branch locally
git branch -d feature/branch-name

# Delete the feature branch remotely
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name
```

### 3. Version Increment
Use npm version to automatically update [package.json](mdc:chatlima/package.json) and create a git tag:

```bash
# For patch releases (0.3.0 -> 0.3.1)
npm version patch

# For minor releases (0.3.0 -> 0.4.0)
npm version minor

# For major releases (0.3.0 -> 1.0.0)
npm version major
```

This command:
- Updates the version in [package.json](mdc:chatlima/package.json)
- Creates a git commit with the version change
- Creates a git tag (e.g., v0.3.1)

### 4. Push Changes
```bash
# Push commits and tags to remote
git push origin main --tags
```

### 5. Create Release Notes
Generate comprehensive release notes following this structure:

#### Template Structure:
```markdown
# 🚀 ChatLima v[VERSION] - [FEATURE_NAME]

## 🎯 What's New
- List major features added
- Highlight user-facing improvements
- Note any new capabilities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Detail technical changes
- Mention new routes, APIs, or components
- Include performance improvements

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- Highlight security enhancements
- Note privacy protections
- Mention any security-related changes

## 📈 Benefits
- Explain user benefits
- Note SEO, performance, or UX improvements
- Highlight business value

## 🔄 Migration Notes
- List any breaking changes (if any)
- Note required configuration changes
- Mention database migrations needed

## 🚀 Deployment
- Deployment instructions
- Environment considerations
- Any special setup requirements

**Full Changelog**: [v[PREV_VERSION]...v[NEW_VERSION]](https://github.com/username/chatlima/compare/v[PREV_VERSION]...v[NEW_VERSION])
```

#### Save Release Notes
Create a file named `RELEASE_NOTES_v[VERSION].md` in the `releases/` folder for reference.

### 6. Safe Production Deployment

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Vercel Production Deployment Safety
Before deploying to production, ensure you're following safe deployment practices:

```bash
# ✅ SAFE - Production deployment workflow
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch with merged changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify everything is ready for production
npm run build  # Test build locally
npm run test   # Run all tests

# 3. Deploy to production explicitly
vercel deploy --prod  # Explicit production deployment

# 4. Verify production deployment
# Check the production URL and test critical functionality
```

#### Production Deployment Checklist:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Feature thoroughly tested on preview deployments
- [ ] Environment variables configured for production
- [ ] Database migrations completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking enabled
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

#### Emergency Rollback:
If issues are discovered after production deployment:
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
vercel deploy --prod     # Deploy previous version
```

### 7. GitHub Release Creation
1. Go to GitHub repository → Releases → "Create a new release"
2. Select the version tag created by `npm version`
3. Copy content from the release notes file
4. Set release title: "v[VERSION] - [FEATURE_NAME]"
5. Mark as "Latest release" if it's the newest version
6. Publish the release

## 📋 Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Complete release workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/[branch-name]
npm version [patch|minor|major]
git push origin main --tags
git branch -d feature/[branch-name]
git push origin --delete feature/[branch-name]
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Version Selection Guidelines:
- **Patch** (0.3.0 → 0.3.1): Bug fixes, small improvements, security patches
- **Minor** (0.3.0 → 0.4.0): New features, significant improvements, new capabilities
- **Major** (0.3.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes, major rewrites, API changes

### Release Notes Guidelines:
- Use emojis for visual appeal and categorization
- Focus on user benefits, not just technical details
- Include migration instructions for any breaking changes
- Highlight security and privacy improvements
- Keep technical details accessible to non-developers
- Reference relevant files using [filename](mdc:chatlima/filename) format

### File References:
- Version information: [package.json](mdc:chatlima/package.json)
- Previous release notes: Look for existing `RELEASE_NOTES_v*.md` files in the `releases/` folder
- Implementation details: Check [app/](mdc:chatlima/app) directory for new routes
- Configuration: [next.config.ts](mdc:chatlima/next.config.ts), [tsconfig.json](mdc:chatlima/tsconfig.json)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Always test the feature thoroughly before merging
- Ensure the production environment can handle new features
- Keep release notes user-focused while including technical details
- Tag releases consistently for easy tracking
- Delete feature branches after successful merge to keep repository clean
- Use descriptive commit messages for the version bump commits
