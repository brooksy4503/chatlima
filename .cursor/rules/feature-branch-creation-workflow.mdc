# Feature Branch Creation Workflow

This rule provides a standardized workflow for creating new feature branches in the ChatLima project, ensuring consistent naming conventions, proper setup, and clear documentation.

## üåü Branch Creation Process

### 1. Pre-Creation Planning
Before creating a new feature branch:
- Define the feature scope and requirements
- Choose an appropriate branch naming convention
- Ensure you're starting from the latest main branch
- Check for any conflicting features in development

### 2. Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive, kebab-case names that clearly identify the feature:

```bash
# Feature branches (new functionality)
feature/auth-integration
feature/polar-payment-system
feature/chat-history-export
feature/user-dashboard-redesign

# Bug fix branches
fix/credit-deduction-bug
fix/negative-balance-blocking
fix/auth-session-timeout

# Enhancement branches
enhance/ui-accessibility
enhance/performance-optimization
enhance/mobile-responsiveness

# Documentation branches
docs/api-documentation
docs/deployment-guide
docs/user-manual-update
```

### 3. Create and Setup Feature Branch

#### Quick Setup Commands:
```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Push the new branch to remote and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Alternative Step-by-Step:
```bash
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create new branch from main
git branch feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Push to remote and set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Initial Branch Setup

#### Create Feature Documentation
Create a brief feature plan (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Create a feature plan file (optional)
touch docs/features/your-feature-name.md
```

#### Feature Plan Template:
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## üéØ Overview
Brief description of what this feature does and why it's needed.

## üìã Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan
1. Step 1: Component/API design
2. Step 2: Core functionality
3. Step 3: UI/UX implementation
4. Step 4: Testing and validation
5. Step 5: Documentation

## üìÅ Files to Modify/Create
- `app/api/new-endpoint/route.ts`
- `components/NewComponent.tsx`
- `lib/new-utility.ts`

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows

## üìù Notes
Any additional notes, considerations, or dependencies.
```

### 5. Development Workflow

#### Regular Commits
Follow conventional commit messages:
```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication middleware"
git commit -m "feat(api): implement payment processing endpoint"

# Fix commits
git commit -m "fix: resolve credit deduction for Google users"
git commit -m "fix(ui): correct mobile navigation alignment"

# Enhancement commits
git commit -m "enhance: improve database query performance"
git commit -m "enhance(ux): add loading states to buttons"

# Documentation commits
git commit -m "docs: add API endpoint documentation"
git commit -m "docs: update deployment instructions"
```

#### Regular Pushes
Push your work regularly to keep the remote branch updated:
```bash
# Push current branch changes
git push

# Or explicitly push to origin
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Keep Branch Updated

#### Sync with Main Regularly
```bash
# Method 1: Merge main into feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git pull origin main

# Method 2: Rebase feature branch onto main (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main

# If conflicts occur during rebase:
# 1. Resolve conflicts in affected files
# 2. Stage resolved files: git add .
# 3. Continue rebase: git rebase --continue
```

## üìã Branch Management Commands

### Useful Git Commands
```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Check branch tracking information
git branch -vv

# See commits unique to your branch
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# See what files have changed
git diff --name-only main

# Stash current work temporarily
git stash
git stash pop  # restore stashed work

# Delete local branch (if no longer needed)
git branch -d feature/branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name
```

### Branch Information
```bash
# See commit history for current branch
git log --oneline -10

# See detailed diff with main
git diff main

# Check if branch is ahead/behind main
git status -uno
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Naming Guidelines:
- Use descriptive names that explain the feature
- Keep names concise but clear
- Use kebab-case (hyphens between words)
- Include the type prefix (feature/, fix/, enhance/, docs/)
- Avoid abbreviations that might be unclear

### Development Guidelines:
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Test your changes regularly
- Keep the branch updated with main to avoid large conflicts
- Document complex changes as you go
- Consider creating draft PRs early for feedback

### Project-Specific Considerations:
For ChatLima specifically, consider these areas when creating branches:
- **Authentication**: Features related to [auth-schema.ts](mdc:auth-schema.ts)
- **API Routes**: New endpoints in [app/api/](mdc:app/api)
- **Database**: Changes requiring [drizzle/](mdc:drizzle) migrations
- **UI Components**: New components in [components/](mdc:components)
- **AI Integration**: Features in [ai/](mdc:ai) directory
- **Payment System**: Polar integration features
- **Credit System**: User credit and usage tracking

### File Organization:
- Keep related changes in logical commits
- Update relevant configuration files ([next.config.ts](mdc:next.config.ts), [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json))
- Add new dependencies to [package.json](mdc:package.json) as needed
- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) if the feature affects setup or usage

## üö® Important Reminders

- Always start from an updated main branch
- Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the feature
- Push branches to remote early to enable collaboration
- Keep feature branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Regularly sync with main to avoid integration conflicts
- Document complex features as you develop them
- Consider the impact on existing functionality
- Test thoroughly before requesting reviews

## üîÑ Integration with Release Workflow

This workflow is designed to work seamlessly with the [feature-release-workflow.mdc](mdc:feature-release-workflow.mdc):

1. **Create branch** using this workflow
2. **Develop feature** following the guidelines here
3. **Merge and release** using the feature release workflow

### Ready for Release Checklist:
- [ ] Feature is complete and tested
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main
- [ ] All commits have clear messages
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main
- [ ] Feature has been tested in development environment
- [ ] Ready to follow the [feature-release-workflow.mdc](mdc:feature-release-workflow.mdc)
