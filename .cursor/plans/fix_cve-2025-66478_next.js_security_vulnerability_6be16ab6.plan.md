# Fix CVE-2025-66478 Next.js Security Vulnerability

## Current State

- **Current Next.js version**: `^15.3.1` (vulnerable)
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Vulnerability**: CVE-2025-66478 (CVSS 10.0 - Critical RCE vulnerability)

## Required Action

Upgrade Next.js to the patched version `15.3.6` for the 15.3.x release line.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update package.json

Update the Next.js dependency in `package.json` from `^15.3.1` to `15.3.6`:

- File: `package.json` (line 85)
- Change: `"next": "^15.3.1"` → `"next": "15.3.6"`

### 2. Update dependencies

Run `pnpm install` to:

- Update `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the new version
- Install Next.js 15.3.6 and its dependencies
- Ensure all related packages are compatible

### 3. Verify installation

Confirm the upgrade by checking:

- `package.json` shows `"next": "15.3.6"`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` reflects the new version
- No breaking changes in the codebase (Next.js 15.3.6 is a patch release, so should be compatible)

## Notes

- This is a patch release (15.3.1 → 15.3.6), so no breaking changes are expected
- The fix addresses a critical RCE vulnerability in React Server Components
- No configuration changes are required - the fix is in the Next.js core
- React version (^19.1.0) should remain compatible with Next.js 15.3.6
