## MCP Server Configuration

This application supports connecting to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access their tools. You can add and manage MCP servers through the settings icon in the chat interface.

### Adding an MCP Server

1. Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to the model selector in the chat interface.
2. Enter a name for your MCP server and optionally a display title for better organization.
3. Select the transport type:
   - **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: For HTTP-based remote servers
   - **stdio (Standard I/O)**: For local servers running on the same machine

#### SSE Configuration

If you select SSE transport:
1. Enter the server URL (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/token/sse`)
2. Click "Add Server"

#### stdio Configuration

If you select stdio transport:
1. Enter the command to execute (e.g., `npx`)
2. Enter the command arguments (e.g., `-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps`)
   - You can enter space-separated arguments or paste a JSON array
3. Click "Add Server"

4. Click "Use" to activate the server for the current chat session.
