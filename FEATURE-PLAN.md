# Feature: Polar Production Checkout

## 🎯 Overview
Implementation of full production Polar checkout flow allowing authenticated users to purchase credits seamlessly, while guiding anonymous users to sign up first. This feature transitions the existing Polar integration to production environment with a user-facing checkout interface.

## 📋 Requirements
- [ ] Update environment configuration for Polar production mode
- [ ] Create reusable CheckoutButton component
- [ ] Integrate checkout button into user menu
- [ ] Handle anonymous vs authenticated user flows
- [ ] Implement proper Vercel deployment testing workflow
- [ ] Verify webhook integration for credit updates

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure production Polar environment variables
2. **Frontend Components**: Create CheckoutButton component with dual user flow handling
3. **UI Integration**: Add checkout button to user menu interface
4. **User Flow Implementation**: Handle anonymous user signup and authenticated user checkout
5. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of both user flows and webhook integration

## 📁 Files to Modify/Create
- `components/checkout-button.tsx` - New checkout button component
- `components/user-menu.tsx` - Integration point for checkout button
- Environment variables (Vercel settings) - Production Polar configuration

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Anonymous user flow: Sign-in redirection and post-auth checkout access
- Authenticated user flow: Direct checkout process and credit updates
- Webhook verification: Credit balance updates after successful payment
- Integration tests: End-to-end checkout process validation

## 🔗 Related Features
- Existing Polar integration (`@polar-sh/better-auth` plugin)
- User authentication system
- Credit tracking and management
- User menu interface

## 🚨 Critical Considerations
- **Vercel Deployment Safety**: Never run initial Vercel setup on feature branches
- **Environment Security**: All production keys must be configured in Vercel settings, never committed
- **User Experience**: Seamless flow for both anonymous and authenticated users
- **Credit Synchronization**: Proper webhook handling for real-time credit updates
