# Feature: Token Usage and Cost Metrics

## 🎯 Overview
This feature will implement comprehensive metrics tracking for token usage and associated costs in the ChatLima application. It will provide detailed insights into API consumption, cost tracking per user/session, and enable better resource management and billing transparency.

## 📋 Requirements
- [ ] Track token usage for each AI model interaction
- [ ] Calculate costs based on token consumption and model pricing
- [ ] Store usage metrics in the database
- [ ] Provide API endpoints to retrieve usage statistics
- [ ] Display usage metrics in the UI
- [ ] Implement cost breakdown by model and time period
- [ ] Add usage limits and warnings
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for usage analytics

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan
1. Step 1: Database schema design for usage metrics
2. Step 2: Implement token tracking middleware
3. Step 3: Create cost calculation service
4. Step 4: Develop API endpoints for usage data
5. Step 5: Build UI components for metrics display
6. Step 6: Integrate with existing chat functionality
7. Step 7: Add admin analytics dashboard
8. Step 8: Testing and validation

## 📁 Files to Modify/Create
- `drizzle/XXXX_token_usage_metrics.sql` (New migration)
- `lib/db/schema.ts` (Update schema)
- `lib/services/token-usage-tracker.ts` (New service)
- `lib/services/cost-calculator.ts` (New service)
- `app/api/usage/route.ts` (New endpoint)
- `app/api/usage/[timeframe]/route.ts` (New endpoint)
- `components/usage-metrics.tsx` (New component)
- `components/cost-breakdown.tsx` (New component)
- `app/admin/usage-analytics/page.tsx` (New admin page)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for token tracking functions
- Integration tests for cost calculations
- API endpoint testing for usage data
- E2E tests for UI components
- Performance testing with high volume scenarios

## 📝 Notes
- Need to consider different pricing models for each AI provider
- Should handle both input and output tokens separately
- Must be GDPR compliant with user data
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed metrics
- Need to handle currency conversion if supporting multiple currencies
