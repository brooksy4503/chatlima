# Testing Guide: Programmatic SEO Features

This guide covers how to test the new programmatic SEO features added in the recent commits.

## New Features Overview

1. **Models Listing Page** (`/models`) - Browse and filter all available AI models
2. **Comparison Pages** (`/compare` and `/compare/[slug]`) - Compare models side-by-side
3. **Dynamic Model Pages** (`/model/[slug]`) - Individual model detail pages
4. **Enhanced SEO** - Dynamic sitemap and robots.txt generation

## Prerequisites

- Development server should be running on port 3000
- If not running, start it with: `pnpm dev`

## Quick Test Commands

### Start Dev Server (if not running)
```bash
# Kill existing server if needed
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)

# Start fresh dev server
pnpm dev:fresh
```

### Test Specific Routes
```bash
# Test models page
open http://localhost:3000/models

# Test compare page
open http://localhost:3000/compare

# Test a specific model
open http://localhost:3000/model/openai-gpt-4o-mini-free

# Test a comparison
open http://localhost:3000/compare/openai-gpt-5-pro-vs-anthropic-claude-3-5-sonnet
```

### Run Automated Tests
```bash
# Run Playwright tests
pnpm test:local

# Run unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Test SEO pages (quick test - 20 models, 10 comparisons)
pnpm test:seo

# Test SEO pages on staging/preview
pnpm test:seo:staging

# Test all SEO pages (100 models, 20 comparisons)
pnpm test:seo:all

# Test with custom parameters
MAX_MODELS=50 MAX_COMPARISONS=15 BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm test:seo
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Model Loading Errors**: Check console for API errors when fetching models
2. **Slug Generation**: Verify slugs are generated correctly (no special characters, proper formatting)
3. **404 Errors**: Check that invalid slugs show proper 404 pages
4. **Performance**: Watch for slow model loading or rendering
5. **Responsive Design**: Verify all pages work on mobile devices
6. **SEO**: Check that metadata is correct for search engines

## Automated SEO Page Testing

A dedicated test script (`scripts/test-seo-pages.ts`) is available to verify that all programmatic SEO pages exist and are accessible.

### Features

- ✅ Tests static pages (/, /models, /compare)
- ✅ Tests top model pages (configurable, default: 20)
- ✅ Tests comparison pages (configurable, default: 10)
- ✅ Tests sitemap.xml (production only)
- ✅ Tests robots.txt
- ✅ Concurrent requests for faster testing
- ✅ Detailed error reporting
- ✅ Works on both dev server and staging

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick test on local dev server (default: 20 models, 10 comparisons)
pnpm test:seo

# Test on staging/preview environment
pnpm test:seo:staging

# Test all pages (100 models, 20 comparisons)
pnpm test:seo:all

# Custom configuration
MAX_MODELS=50 MAX_COMPARISONS=15 BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm test:seo

# Test on production (if you have access)
BASE_URL=https://chatlima.com MAX_MODELS=100 pnpm test:seo
```

### Environment Variables

- `BASE_URL`: Base URL to test against (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `MAX_MODELS`: Maximum number of model pages to test (default: `20`)
- `MAX_COMPARISONS`: Maximum number of comparison pages to test (default: `10`)
- `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`: Number of concurrent requests (default: `5`)

### Output

The script provides:
- ✅ Pass/fail status for each page
- ⚠️ Error details for failed pages
- 📊 Summary statistics
- ⏱️ Total execution time

### Testing on Staging

To test on `preview.chatlima.com`:

```bash
# Quick test
pnpm test:seo:staging

# Full test
BASE_URL=https://preview.chatlima.com MAX_MODELS=100 MAX_COMPARISONS=20 pnpm test:seo
```

**Note**: The script is lightweight and safe to run on staging. It only makes GET requests and doesn't modify any data.

## Notes

- The sitemap only generates in production (chatlima.com domain)
- Model pages use static generation for top 100 models
- Comparison pages use static generation for prebuilt comparisons
- All pages should be responsive and mobile-friendly
- The test script can verify page existence but not content quality - manual review is still recommended
