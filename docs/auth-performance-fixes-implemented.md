# Auth Performance Fixes Implemented

## Summary
Implemented critical performance optimizations to reduce excessive auth session API calls from ~16+ per page load to 1-2 calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Aggressive React Query Refetching
**File:** `app/providers.tsx`
- Set `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`
- Set `refetchOnMount: false`
- Set `refetchOnReconnect: false`

**Impact:** Prevents automatic refetching of all queries (including auth) when user switches windows or components remount.

### 2. Created Centralized Auth Context
**File:** `lib/context/auth-context.tsx`
- Single `useSession()` call for entire app
- Centralized usage data fetching with 5-minute cache
- Consolidated auth state management

**Impact:** Eliminates multiple independent `useSession()` calls across 6+ components.

### 3. Updated useAuth Hook
**File:** `hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Now re-exports from centralized auth context
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Impact:** All components now share single auth state instead of making independent calls.

### 4. Added Auth Performance Monitor
**File:** `lib/utils/auth-performance-monitor.ts`
- Tracks all auth-related API calls
- Warns when excessive calls detected
- Provides detailed metrics in development

**Usage:** Automatically starts in development mode, reports every 5 seconds.

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization:
- 6 components Ã— useSession() = 6 auth checks
- Additional usage data fetches
- Refetch on every window focus
- **Total: ~16+ auth API calls per interaction**

### After Optimization:
- 1 centralized useSession() call
- Cached usage data (5-minute TTL)
- No automatic refetching
- **Total: 1-2 auth API calls per page load**

## Testing the Changes

1. Start the dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Open browser DevTools Console
3. Look for "Auth Performance Monitor" logs
4. Navigate between pages and observe call counts

### What to Look For:
- Initial page load: Should see 1-2 auth calls max
- Page navigation: Should see minimal or no additional auth calls
- Window focus changes: Should NOT trigger auth refetches
- Console warnings if excessive calls detected

## Next Steps

### If Performance Issues Persist:
1. Check console for specific endpoints being called repeatedly
2. Look for components not yet migrated to centralized auth
3. Verify Better Auth client-side caching is working
4. Consider implementing server-side session caching

### Future Optimizations:
1. Implement Better Auth session caching configuration
2. Batch auth and usage endpoints into single call
3. Add server-side session cache with Redis
4. Implement progressive auth loading

## Monitoring Commands

```javascript
// In browser console to check current metrics:
window.authMonitor?.getMetrics()

// To reset metrics:
window.authMonitor?.reset()

// To manually trigger report:
window.authMonitor?.report()
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these files:
1. `app/providers.tsx` - Remove AuthProvider, restore React Query settings
2. `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Restore original implementation
3. `lib/context/auth-context.tsx` - Delete file
4. `app/layout.tsx` - Remove performance monitor import
