# Chat PDF Export Feature Plan

## Overview
Implement a feature that allows users to download their chat conversations as PDF files. This will provide users with an offline, shareable format of their chat history.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can export any of their chats to PDF format
- PDF includes chat title and creation date in header
- PDF contains all text messages (user and assistant roles)
- Simple, clean text-based PDF layout
- Download triggered via button in chat interface

### Technical Requirements
- Server-side PDF generation using jsPDF library
- New API endpoint: `/api/chats/[id]/export-pdf`
- Authentication required (user must own the chat)
- Error handling for invalid chats, missing data, generation failures
- Lightweight PDF format (no images, complex styling)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast generation (target < 2 seconds for typical chats)
- Secure (no access to other users' chats)
- Reliable (proper error handling and user feedback)
- Maintainable (clean, documented code)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies
1. Install jsPDF library for PDF generation
2. Create utility functions for PDF formatting
3. Set up basic project structure for the feature

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
1. Create API endpoint `/api/chats/[id]/export-pdf`
   - Validate user authentication
   - Fetch chat data using existing `getChatById` function
   - Extract text content from message parts
   - Generate PDF with proper formatting
   - Return PDF as downloadable file

2. Implement PDF generation logic:
   - Header with chat title and creation date
   - Message formatting (User/Assistant labels)
   - Proper text wrapping and pagination
   - Clean, readable typography

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. Add download button to chat interface
   - Position near other chat actions (share, delete)
   - Icon: download or document icon
   - Loading state during PDF generation
   - Error handling with user feedback

2. Implement download functionality:
   - API call to export endpoint
   - Handle file download in browser
   - Show progress and error states

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish
1. Unit tests for PDF generation utility
2. Integration tests for API endpoint
3. E2E tests for download functionality
4. Error scenario testing
5. Performance testing with large chats

## Technical Architecture

### API Endpoint Structure
```
GET /api/chats/[id]/export-pdf
Authorization: Bearer token
Response: PDF file download
```

### PDF Structure
```
Chat Title: [Chat Title]
Created: [Creation Date]

User: [Message content]
Assistant: [Message content]
User: [Message content]
...
```

### Error Handling
- 401: Authentication required
- 403: Chat not owned by user
- 404: Chat not found
- 500: PDF generation failed

## Dependencies
- jsPDF: For PDF generation
- Existing chat infrastructure (getChatById, authentication)

## Security Considerations
- User authentication required
- Chat ownership validation
- No sensitive data in PDF (API keys, etc.)
- Rate limiting considerations

## Future Enhancements
- Include message timestamps
- Add chat metadata (model used, token counts)
- Support for images in PDF
- Custom PDF styling options
- Batch export of multiple chats

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully download PDFs of their chats
- PDF contains all text content in readable format
- Feature works reliably across different chat sizes
- No performance impact on chat loading
- Clean integration with existing UI

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 days (setup and utilities)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days (backend implementation)
- Phase 3: 1-2 days (frontend integration)
- Phase 4: 1-2 days (testing and polish)

Total estimated: 5-9 days for complete implementation
